For this challenge , i used Binwalk tool which is used to search embeded files and images.<br />
To extract all information stored in that picture , i used this tool and stored the data in a textfile output.txt <br />
After which i used ```strings output.txt``` to get all human-readable strings (since resultant flag is a human readable string) and thus we can find the flag. <br />

The flag is ```inctfj{string5_m4keth_fl4gs}```
